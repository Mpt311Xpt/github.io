# Bastian Balthazar Bux 

Bastian Balthazar Bux is a shy and bookish boy around 12 years old who is raised by his father and still mourning the sudden death of his mother (she died of an unspecified illness). 
He is a dreamer, who is shunned by other children due to his immense imagination. 
During a visit to an antique bookstore, he steals a curious-looking book titled The Neverending Story, and upon reading it finds himself literally drawn into the story. 
Halfway through the book, Bastian becomes a character in The Neverending Story, in a world called Fantastica.("Fantasia" in the films, sometimes).
